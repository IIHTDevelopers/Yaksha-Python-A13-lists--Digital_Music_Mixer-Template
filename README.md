1. PROJECT ABSTRACT
SoundByte Labs requires a digital music mixing tool to generate and manipulate sound patterns for their audio production workflow. The application will create varied amplitude patterns for different sound types (bass, melody, percussion, ambient), apply transformations to these patterns, and provide visual representation of the results. This console application will help sound engineers prototype rhythmic and melodic structures through mathematical pattern manipulation before implementing them in full audio production.

2. BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

Application must create and manipulate numerical lists representing patterns
System must demonstrate basic list operations (slicing, concatenation, reversal, etc.)
Program must apply various transformations to lists (reverse, slice, extend, shuffle)
Application must visualize lists in a readable format

3. CONSTRAINTS
3.1 INPUT REQUIREMENTS

Patterns represented as lists of integers (0-100)

Each integer represents an amplitude value
Values must be in range 0-100


Four pattern types available:

Bass patterns: Strong beats with lower values
Melody patterns: Varied amplitudes
Percussion patterns: Sharp peaks
Ambient patterns: Smooth, gradually changing values


User input required for:

Pattern type selection
Pattern length specification
Transformation selection
Transformation parameters



3.2 OPERATION CONSTRAINTS

List Creation Operations:

Create patterns using list comprehensions
Generate random values within specified ranges
Build lists with specific characteristics for each pattern type


List Manipulation Operations:

Apply list slicing using [start:end:step] notation
Perform list reversal using [::-1] syntax
Implement list repetition using multiplication * n
Execute list concatenation using + operator
Implement segment shuffling using list subdivision and reassembly



3.3 OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS

Application Interface:

Show "List Operations Lab" as application title
Display clear menu options for pattern creation and transformation
Present transformation options with corresponding list operation syntax


List Visualization:

Represent lists using ASCII art visualization
Show list indices for reference
Display list length and type information
Indicate list transformation applied

6. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
6.1 VARIABLES AND DATA STRUCTURES

patterns: List of created patterns

Format: [pattern1, pattern2, ...]
Each pattern is a list of integers (0-100)


active_pattern: Currently selected pattern

Format: List of integers
Example: [80, 25, 40, 90, 30, 85, 45, 65]


continue_running: Boolean flag for main program loop

6.2 LIST OPERATIONS

List Slicing: pattern[start:end:step]

Example: [1,2,3,4,5,6][1:5:2] yields [2,4]


List Reversal: pattern[::-1]

Example: [1,2,3,4,5][::-1] yields [5,4,3,2,1]


List Multiplication: pattern * repeats

Example: [1,2,3] * 2 yields [1,2,3,1,2,3]


List Concatenation: pattern1 + pattern2

Example: [1,2,3] + [4,5] yields [1,2,3,4,5]


List Segmentation: Breaking a list into chunks

Example: [1,2,3,4,5,6] with segment size 2 becomes [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]



6.3 PATTERN TYPES AND CHARACTERISTICS

Bass Pattern:

Strong beats at regular intervals (every 4th position)
Higher values (60-100) at beats, lower values (20-50) elsewhere


Melody Pattern:

Varied amplitudes around a base value
Gradual changes between adjacent values


Percussion Pattern:

Sharp contrast between high and low values
Alternating between high (80-100) and low (0-10) values


Ambient Pattern:

Smooth transitions between values
Small random changes (+/-5) from previous value
